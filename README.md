# surfs_up
## Overview

Purpose of this analysis was to find temperature data for June and December. This will
help us understand if the surf and ice cream shop can be run all year.

### Resources

- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas

## Results

### Deliverable 1

- After running analysis for June temperature demonstrates that mean is 74 with min and max of 
64 and 85 respectively. This signals that customers will come out and purchase ice cream
due to the hot temperatures. 

- If the temp is this for June then we can predict that July
and August will only be hotter resulting in more sales. We can also further use location
of Oahu to further our prediction of warmer weather in the coming summer months

### Deliverable 2

- After running analysis for December temperature demonstrates that mean is 71 with min and max
of 56 and 83 which is very close in temperature to June. This helps solidify our prediction
that it would be beneficial to run both businesses year round.

## Summary

Results demonstrate that the surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable year round.
The ice cream shop will most definitely have more customers in the summer months but 
although there will be a drop in customers in December, the drop will not be considerable
and recommend to stay open all year. The surf shop should also stay open all year round 
due to the temperature drop not being too large in the winter months.

### Additional queries

The queries I would run would be to check precipitation by month to understand and
predict customer traffic. This is because precipitation has an outsized effect on 
customer traffic. 

Other query I would run would be to check how sunny/cloudy month of June and December are.
This also has an outsized effect on customer traffic so its deemed important to understand and predict
this weather pattern.
